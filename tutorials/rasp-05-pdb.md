# RNA Structure Prediction (RASP) - 05 - Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## Protein Data Bank (PDB)
Protein Data Bank (PDB) is by far the most popular dataset in the field of structural biology and it is the largest source for structures of various biological molecules and assemblies.

PDB consists of many

Besides popular macromolecules such as proteins, RNA and DNA, PDB entries also often contain smaller molecules (e.g. ligands) but in this tutorial we will not deal with them.
