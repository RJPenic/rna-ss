# RNA Structure Prediction (RASP) - 03 - Pseudoknot Detection

Before we try predicting the structure itself, let's try doing something a bit simpler. We'll try to predict whether or not a certain RNA folds into a structure with pseudoknot based on the RNA sequence alone. Basically, we are doing a relatively simple binary classification where the input in our model is RNA sequence.
